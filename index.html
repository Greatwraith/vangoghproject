            <h2>Who is He?</h2>
            <p>
                His name is Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890); he was a post-impressionist artist from the Netherlands whose
                paintings are highly renowned in art history. His dramatic brushstrokes, vibrant use of color, and
                mastery in capturing moments and depicting light are considered revolutionary. Only gaining popularity
                later in his life, his struggles and passion opened the world's eyes to what it truly means to be an
                artist.

            <h2>How Did He Become a Famous Painter?</h2>
            <p>
                Vincent van Gogh became a legendary painter largely due to the profound emotional depth, innovative
                techniques, and unique style he brought to his art, which deeply influenced the course of modern
                painting. His rise to legendary status, however, was a complex journey. Over time, Van Gogh’s work
                became celebrated as visionary, and his life story of struggle and passion only added to the legend
                that surrounds him today.

                    while he was staying at a mental asylum in France. It depicts a swirling night sky with bright stars

                    crescent moon over a quiet village. Known for its bold colors and expressive brushstrokes, the
                    painting reflects Van Gogh's emotional intensity and unique style. It is one of the most iconic

                    <strong><q>Sunflowers</q></strong> is a famous painting by Vincent van Gogh created between 1888
                    and 1889, featuring vibrant yellow sunflowers in various stages of bloom arranged in a vase. Van
                    Gogh painted
                    these while living in Arles, France. The paintings are notable for their bold yellows and thick,
                    expressive brushstrokes, which bring the flowers to life and convey a sense of warmth and joy. Van
                    Gogh saw the sunflowers as symbols of friendship and gratitude, making these works not just
                    beautiful but also deeply meaningful. Currently, it is stored and displayed in the Van Gogh Museum
                    Amsterdam.

                    vibrant bunch of blue and purple irises, showcasing his bold colors and thick brushstrokes. Van Gogh
                    was inspired by the beauty of nature around him, and he arranged the flowers in a lively way that
                    gives a sense of movement. This painting is celebrated for its emotional depth and unique style,
                    reflecting van Gogh's love for flowers. Today, this version of "Irises" is stored and displayed in
                    the
